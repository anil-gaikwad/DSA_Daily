########################## 1. Subsets II ########################## 
# Q 1. Subsets II
# Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates, return all possible Subsets (the power set).
# The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,2]
# Output: [[ ],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
#--------------------------- Solution --------------------------------# 


########################## 2. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number ########################## 
# Q 2. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
# Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter
# combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.
# A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

# Example 1:
# Input: digits = "23"
# Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

#--------------------------- Solution --------------------------------# 


########################## 3. Combination Sum ########################## 

# Q 3. Combination Sum
# Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target,
# return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. 
# You may return the combinations in any order. The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of
# times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
# The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations
# that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

# Example 1:
# Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
# Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]

#--------------------------- Solution --------------------------------# 

########################## 4. Combination Sum II ########################## 

# Q 4. Combination Sum II
# Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), 
# find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.
# Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.
# Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

# Example 1:
# Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
# Output:[[1,1,6],[1,2,5],[1,7],[2,6]]

#--------------------------- Solution --------------------------------# 

########################## 5. Permutations ########################## 
# Q 5. Permutations
# Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations.
# You can return the answer in any order.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3]
# Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]

#--------------------------- Solution --------------------------------# 


########################## 6. Permutations II ########################## 

# Q 6. Permutations II
# Given a collection of numbers, nums, that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations in any order.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,1,2]
# Output: [[1,1,2], [1,2,1], [2,1,1]]

#--------------------------- Solution --------------------------------# 

########################## 7. Palindrome Partitioning ########################## 

# Q 7. Palindrome Partitioning
# Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. 
# Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "aab"
# Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]

#--------------------------- Solution --------------------------------# 

########################## 8. N-Queens ########################## 
# Q 8. N-Queens
# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
# Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.
# Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen 
# and an empty space, respectively.

# Example 1:
# Input: n = 4
# Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]

#--------------------------- Solution --------------------------------# 


########################## Q 9. Combination Sum III ########################## 

# Q 9. Combination Sum III
# Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:
# • Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.
# • Each number is used at most once.
# Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and 
# the combinations may be returned in any order.

# Example 1:
# Input: k = 3, n = 7
# Output: [[1,2,4]]

########################## 10. Sudoku Solver ########################## 

# Q 10. Sudoku Solver
# Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
# A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:
# Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
# Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
# Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
# The '.' character indicates empty cells.

# Example 1:
# Input: board =
# [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["

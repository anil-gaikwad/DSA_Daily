# Q 1. Kth Largest Element in an Array
# Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element
# in the array.
# Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct
# element.
# You must solve it in O(n) time complexity.
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
# Output: 5


# Q 2. Ugly Number II
# An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3,
# and 5.
# Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 10
# Output: 12


# Q 3. Sort Characters By Frequency
# Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the
# characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in
# the string.
# Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "tree"
# Output: "eert"

# Q 4. Top K Frequent Words
# Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent
# strings.
# Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the
# words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.
# Example 1:
# Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
# Output: ["i","love"]


# Q 5. Find Median from Data Stream
# The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list
# is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle
# values.
# • For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
# • For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
# Implement the MedianFinder class:
# • MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
# • void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to
# the data structure.
# • double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far. Answers
# within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
# Example 1:
# Input
# ["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
# [[ ], [1], [2], [ ], [3], [ ]]
# Output
# [null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

# Q 6. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums
# You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 sorted in ascending order
# and an integer k.
# Define a pair (u, v) which consists of one element from the first array and one
# element from the second array.
# Return the k pairs (u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (uk, vk) with the smallest sums.
# Example 1:
# Input: nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6], k = 3
# Output: [[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]]


# Q 7. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix
# Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in
# ascending order, return the kth smallest element in the matrix.
# Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct
# element.
# You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n2).
# Example 1:
# Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
# Output: 13


# Q 8. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums
# You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 sorted in ascending order
# and an integer k.
# Define a pair (u, v) which consists of one element from the first array and one
# element from the second array.
# Return the k pairs (u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (uk, vk) with the smallest sums.
# Example 1:
# Input: nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6], k = 3
# Output: [[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]]


# Q 9. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix
# Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in
# ascending order, return the kth smallest element in the matrix.
# Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct
# element.
# You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n2).
# Example 1:
# Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
# Output: 13


# Q 10. Reorganize String
# Given a string s, rearrange the characters of s so that any two adjacent
# characters are not the same.
# Return any possible rearrangement of s or return "" if not possible.
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "aab"
# Output: "aba"
